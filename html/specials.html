    <h2>70th Anniversary of The Commonwealth </h2>
    <p>2019 is the 70th anniversary of the modern Commonwealth. Each year, a new Commonwealth theme is chosen and announced on Commonwealth Day. The theme becomes the focus for activities undertaken during that year throughout the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p>The 2019 Commonwealth theme 'A Connected Commonwealth' highlights the ongoing global engagement made possible as our Commonwealth family of nations work together in friendship</p>
    <p>Commonwealth Nations work together to protect the natural environment and the oceans. So many of our Commonwealth nations are connected shore-to-shore. The Commonwealth Games encourage all young people to participate in sport for peace and friendship. Commonwealth Nations and Commonwealth organisations encourage empowerment and inclusion for all people - particularly women, young people and developing communities.</p>
    <p>St. Johnâ€™s Cathedral is hosting a significant multi-faith service to celebrate 70 years of Commonwealth diversity on Tuesday 12th March at 9.30am for 10am start, concludes 11am.</p>
